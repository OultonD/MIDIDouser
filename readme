This is the code and schematic for an Arduino based controller for Dousing projectors with QLab over MIDI.

Background:
This device was designed to control three modified CD trays which were mounted to completely block the light coming out of our projectors. 
Since these dowsers could be triggered by our show control computer, it allowed for perfectly synced complete blackouts.
